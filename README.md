## PHP with laravel 
start the php app from 'php' folder using: `php artisan serve`
## Node app using VUE
start the vue app from vue-app folder using: `npm run serve`


    ### NOTE:
    - you'll need a mysql server to load the `training01.sql` file
    - vue app is using the php root as an API to do the requests, to run both apps you need a chrome extension CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf
